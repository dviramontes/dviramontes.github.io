It was generated using the 
awesome [Cryogen static site generator](http://cryogenweb.org/)
by Carmen La and 
written in [Clojure](http://clojure.com/).
If you haven't taken a close look at Clojure lately, you 
totally should! It's an amazing software ecosystem 
[which thrives on simplicity and functional programming](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).

### About the blurred background images:

They come from a large colleciton of images that has inspired me over the years. Some of them are of my own making but most will not be. If you would like to inquire about the source or author of a particular one, go to your web inspector console and send me an [email](mailto:dviramontes@gmail.com) with the numbers you see there. Thanks.
