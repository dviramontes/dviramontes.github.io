### about the title

The title of this blog was inspired in part by my 
tendencies to explore unknown territories in technology. Specially the type of tech that disrupts **status quo** in software development. Although this blog will be mostly about tech, I didn't want to limit my thoughts to simply tech [nothing is strictly tech](..).

#### small aside:
When I say technology, I mean to say software but since software cannot exist by self. I say tech because it requires people, hardware, and ideas, and belief systems[cough... small religions].

[Wikipedia defines **here be dragons** as:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)

> "Here be dragons" means dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of a supposed medieval practice of putting dragons, sea serpents and other mythological creatures in uncharted areas of maps."

I think thats very fitting of the sentiment I want to give this blog.

It was also *indirectly* inspired by the title of this postcast ["here be monsters"](http://www.hbmpodcast.com/). I say indirectly, because the postcast is not about software but I like the idea that, not unlike the potcast, the name can be inhibition free about the ideas allows [her|him]-self to have given such title.
